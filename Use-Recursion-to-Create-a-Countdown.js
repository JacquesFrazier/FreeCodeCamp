//problem

//As mentioned in the previous challenge, there will be a base case. The base case tells the recursive function when it no longer needs to call itself. It is a simple case where the return value is already known. There will also be a recursive call which executes the original function with different arguments. If the function is written correctly, eventually the base case will be reached.

//For example, say you want to write a recursive function that returns an array containing the numbers 1 through n. This function will need to accept an argument, n, representing the final number. Then it will need to call itself with progressively smaller values of n until it reaches 1. You could write the function as follows:

function countup(n) {
  if (n < 1) {
    return [];
  } else {
    const countArray = countup(n - 1);
    countArray.push(n);
    return countArray;
  }
}
console.log(countup(5));

//The value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will be displayed in the console.

//At first, this seems counterintuitive since the value of n decreases, but the values in the final array are increasing. This happens because the push happens last, after the recursive call has returned. At the point where n is pushed into the array, countup(n - 1) has already been evaluated and returned [1, 2, ..., n - 1].


//question 
//We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n). The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter. If the function is called with a number less than 1, the function should return an empty array. For example, calling this function with n = 5 should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind.


//answer 1

function countdown(n){
    if (n < 1) {
      return [];
    } else {
      const arr = countdown(n - 1);
      arr.unshift(n);
      return arr;
    }
  }

//answer 2

function countdown(n) {
    if (n < 1) {
      return [];
    } else {
      const arr = countdown(n - 1);
      arr.splice(0, 0, n);
      return arr;
    }
  }

//answer 3

function countdown(n){
    return n < 1 ? [] : [n].concat(countdown(n - 1));
 }

//answer 4

function countdown(n){
    return n < 1 ? [] : [n, ...countdown(n - 1)];
 }
